SorcererLeapOVR
A LeapOVR game concept

SorcererLeapOVR is a game concept, trying to get the best of the oculus rift and the leapmotion to get an innovative handfree gameplay.

Commands : right arm :

    -closed fist to move forward, your hand depth define your speed
    -put your hand up to jump
    -open your hand facing forward and extending your arm to shoot
    
left arm :

    -use the arm pad to choose your weapon (click with your right hand index), face your forearm to see the pad
    -open your hand facing forward and extending your arm to shoot
    -use your wrist to turn left or right

There is no game goal yet, just pratice on destroying the flying orbs around you with your weapons.
This is only a draft, optimization willl come in time.
